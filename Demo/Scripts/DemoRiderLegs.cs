    /// The animation library has no riding clip. Its chair-sitting loop is close — seated,
    /// knees bent — but the thighs are parallel and horizontal, which on a horse puts them
    /// straight through the widest part of the barrel: measured, **24% of the rider's leg
    /// vertices ended up inside the horse's mesh**.
    ///
    /// This is done here, after the animator has posed the skeleton, rather than by editing
    /// the clip, because **the library's clips cannot be re-posed by their muscle curves**.
    /// They carry humanoid IK goal curves (`LeftFootT`/`LeftFootQ` and the right-hand pair),
    /// and the goals win: a derived clip with the thigh muscles rewritten evaluates with the
    /// feet in exactly their original positions and the legs barely moved. Stripping the goal
    /// curves does not help either — without them the pose collapses. Rotating the bones
    /// afterwards sidesteps the whole mechanism, and has the side benefit that the same
    /// adjustment holds for whatever clip is playing.
    ///
    /// Attach to the riding model, beside its <see cref="Animator"/>.
